  I'm a researcher in the <a href="https://neurocy.notion.site/Future-of-Programming-Lab-241d162461a04064ae1fd9ae32bf4cb1">Future of Programming Lab</a> at the University of Michigan,
  where my work focuses on programming languages, specifically <a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a>, a live functional programming language.
  I'm interested in utilizing the intersection of Programming Language Theory and Human-Computer Interaction to make the power of computing better for everyone.
  My long-term vision is to extend live programming into creating <a href="https://malleable.systems">malleable software</a> by integrating programming language structures into end-user interfaces.
  Before my research career, I worked as a professional software engineer for over a decade.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of my research, Iâ€™m a novice climber, always looking to improve and tackle new challenges.
