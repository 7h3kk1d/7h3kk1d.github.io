Now that I have some free time off from school I've decided to rebuild the blog. I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with markdown pages for content.

Over the next few weeks I have a few features I'd like to add before I consider it in a *done* state.

#### Todo:
* RSS
* Search
* Tagging
* Convert inline CSS to [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* Comments
* Sharing
* Hopefully some better styling
